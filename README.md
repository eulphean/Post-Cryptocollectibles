# Post-Cryptocollectibles
In 2018, Amay Kataria was invited by [Jessica Angel](http://www.jessicaangelarts.com/) to attend the Ethereal Summit in New York City. There, he stared creating a new ontology of cryptocollectibles like CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties by reapproiating his own assets as [Post-Cryptocollectibles](https://amaykataria.com/#/PostCryptocollectible). This repository contains the custom software to create those reappropriations. 

This project is developed using an open-source creative coding library called [Open-Frameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).
