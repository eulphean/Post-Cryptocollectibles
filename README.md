# Ontology-of-Cryptocollectibles
In 2018, Amay was invited by [Jessica Angel](http://www.jessicaangelarts.com/) to attend the Ethereal Summit in New York City. There, he stared creating a new ontology of cryptocollectibles like CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties by reapproiating his own assets. This repository contains the custom software to create on of those reappropriations.
